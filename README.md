# Income Prediction

Here, we are dealing with a Binary Classification problem at hand wherein the main objective is to predict whether an individual's income is >$50K or <=$50K. So, the reponse variable Income has two categories here -- 'Yes' if the salary is >$50K and 'No' if the salary is <=$50K.

Main steps involved in this case study:

1) Business Problem Understanding

2) Hypothesis generation

3) Reading the data

4) Understanding the data (Exploratory Data Analysis)

    - Univariate Analysis

    - Bivariate Analysis
5) Missing Values and Outliers treatment

6) Feature Engineering

7) Evaluation metric for this Classification Problem

8) One-hot encoding

9) Modeling and Evaluation

    - Logistic Regression

    - Random Forest

    - XGBoost
